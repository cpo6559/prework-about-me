      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi everyone! I'm Cami from Miami. I'm a recent college grad from Rice University. 
        During my time at Rice, I worked about 45 hours per week caregiving and tutoring children. 
        I was able to use that money to graduate debt free and purchase my first investment property right before graduation at the age of 21. 
        Now that I'm 22 and settled into my day job, I've written some financial self help books to help BIPOC college students and those new to adulthood save their first $10,000.
        In the process of working with someone to make the website for my books, I noticed it would be easier to communicate what I want if I had the technical knowledge.
        And that's what has guide me to this coding boot camp. I'm so excited to start.
